## 💵 The Ultimate Commercial Core
Unlike LoRAs and workflows tied to restrictive non-commercial licenses, **this entire architecture is 100% free for commercial use.** 

* **Indie Game Devs:** Generate menus, title screens, and concept art locally.
* **Content Creators:** Automate flashy and unique marketing image generation.
* **IP Creators:** Monetize your original marketing images, workflows, and visual outputs with zero subscription overhead.

`SuperklokStyleLoRAv2` was created with the help of `MarketingToolkitSL`, which specializes in turning primitive MS Paint drawings, combined with text prompts, into highly detailed 100% commercially usable images. The original uploaded reference image `Superklok Labs Banner.png` for the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2` began as a primitive MS Paint drawing, here are the steps of its development using `MarketingToolkitSL` workflows.

## INSTALLATION GUIDE

## 🎨 Step-by-Step Setup: ComfyUI Automation Workflow

Follow these steps to configure the image-generation pipeline. This workflow is optimized to run on a single 16GB VRAM graphics card.

### Prerequisites
* An NVIDIA GPU with 16GB+ VRAM (Optimized for RTX 4070 Ti, 5070 Ti, or similar).
* The `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\dataset\20_SuperklokStyle\` folder.
* The `ComfyUI Workflow - SuperklokStyleLoRAv2.json` workflow file included in the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder.
* The `captioner.py` script in the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder.

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Download the **SuperklokStyleLoRAv2** GitHub repository directly to the folder location where you intend to run your applications. **SuperklokStyleLoRAv2** is a fully portable and 100% offline-capable environment. All related application files, models, and caches live strictly inside the main installation folder. Once set up, you can completely disconnect your system from the internet without losing any functionality.

### Step 1: Install ComfyUI (Portable Windows Build)

<img src="Screenshots/git.png" width="70%"/>

1. You will first need to install Git for Windows from the official page (https://gitforwindows.org/). The direct download link is https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.55.0.windows.3/Git-2.55.0.3-64-bit.exe

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI installer.png" width="70%"/>

2. Download the official **ComfyUI Windows Portable Build** from the ComfyUI Downloads Page (https://docs.comfy.org/installation/comfyui_portable_windows).

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI folder.png" width="70%"/>

3. Extract the downloaded `ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z` archive into your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder, then go inside the resulting `ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia` folder and not the `.7z` archive.

4. Open the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable` folder. You will see several batch files, an `advanced` folder, a main `ComfyUI` folder, a `python_embeded` folder, and an `Update` folder.

> ⚠️ **NOTE:**Make sure the `ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia` folder contains all the ComfyUI files and is placed directly in the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder.

### Step 2: Configure the VRAM-Optimized Startup Script

To prevent ComfyUI from locking your graphics card and crashing your local chatbot backend, modify the startup configurations:

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI files.png" width="70%"/>

1. Right-click the file named `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` and select **Edit** (or open it with Notepad).

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI custom start script.png" width="80%"/>

2. Replace the entire default text line at the top of the file with the following optimized command:
   ```python
   .\python_embeded\python.exe -s ComfyUI\main.py --windows-standalone-build --fp8_e4m3fn-text-enc --use-pytorch-cross-attention
   ```
3. Save the `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` file and close your text editor. 

---

### Step 3: Download the ComfyUI Manager

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI cmd.png" width="85%"/>

1. Browse to your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\custom_nodes` folder and open a Command Prompt inside that folder by clicking in the **Address Bar** at the top, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter. This will open a Command Prompt terminal in your `custom_nodes` folder.

2. Once the black box (Command Prompt) pops up, type the following into it and press Enter: 
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager comfyui-manager
   ```
3. Close the Command Prompt terminal window once the download operation is complete.

### Step 4: Load the Automated Workflow & Dependencies 

<img src="Screenshots/stable diffusion.png" width="40%"/> ➡️ <img src="Screenshots/checkpoint.png" width="40%"/>

1. Download `sd3.5_large_fp8_scaled.safetensors` from https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/stable-diffusion-3.5-fp8/blob/main/sd3.5_large_fp8_scaled.safetensors and place it in your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\models\checkpoints` folder.

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI files.png" width="60%"/>

2. Browse to your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable` folder and double-click your modified `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` file. A browser window will open automatically at `http://127.0.0.1:8188`. It may take a couple minutes to launch for the first time after installing ComfyUI.

3. Locate the `ComfyUI Workflow - SuperklokStyleLoRAv2.json` workflow file inside the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder.

<img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI load workflow.png" width="40%"/> ➡️ <img src="Screenshots/ComfyUI loaded workflow.png" width="40%"/>

4. Drag and drop the `ComfyUI Workflow - SuperklokStyleLoRAv2.json` workflow file directly into the ComfyUI browser interface to load the automated pipeline.

<img src="Screenshots/dataset.png" width="60%"/>

5. Browse to your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\dataset` folder and copy the `20_SuperklokStyle` folder.

<img src="Screenshots/input dataset.png" width="60%"/>

6. Paste the `20_SuperklokStyle` dataset into the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\input` folder.

<img src="Screenshots/run ComfyUI.png" width="60%"/>

7. Enter the number of LoRAs you would like to train sequentially, then press `Run` to train the amount of LoRAs you requested. Your trained LoRA files can be found in the `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI\output\models\loras` folder.

<img src="Screenshots/trained LoRA.png" width="60%"/>

When training your own LoRAs, you can use the `captioner.py` script found in your `SuperklokStyleLoRAv2\` folder to create `.txt` files to accompany each of your LoRA training images.
